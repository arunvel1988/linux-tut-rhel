`/` (Root Directory)
  
Top-level directory** in Linux from which all other directories branch.
It contains all system and user data.
Only root user has write permission here.


`/bin` — Essential User Binaries

* Contains **essential command binaries** like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `bash`, etc.
* These commands are required for basic operations in **single-user mode**.

---

### 📁 `/boot` — **Boot Loader Files**

* Holds **boot loader** files such as `vmlinuz` (Linux kernel), `initrd`, and `grub.cfg`.
* Required to **boot** the Linux system.

---

### 📁 `/dev` — **Device Files**

* Contains special files representing **hardware devices**.

  * E.g., `/dev/sda1` for disk, `/dev/tty` for terminal.
* Enables device communication as if they were files.

---

### 📁 `/etc` — **Configuration Files**

* Contains **system-wide configuration** files.
* Examples:

  * `/etc/passwd`: User info
  * `/etc/hosts`: IP and hostname mapping
  * `/etc/fstab`: Filesystem mount points

---

### 📁 `/home` — **User Home Directories**

* Stores **personal directories for each user** (e.g., `/home/arun`).
* Users store personal files, configs, and downloads here.

---

### 📁 `/lib`, `/lib64` — **Shared Libraries**

* Contains **shared libraries** (similar to DLLs in Windows).
* Required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

---

### 📁 `/media` — **Mount Points for Removable Media**

* Automatically used to mount **USB drives, CDs, DVDs**.
* Example: `/media/usb`, `/media/cdrom`.

---

### 📁 `/mnt` — **Temporary Mount Point**

* Used for **manually mounting** filesystems like external disks or ISO images.
* Admin typically uses this directory.

---

### 📁 `/opt` — **Optional Software**

* Contains **third-party and proprietary** applications.
* Example: `/opt/google`, `/opt/vmware`.

---

### 📁 `/proc` — **Process and Kernel Info**

* A **virtual filesystem** that exposes real-time system info.
* Examples:

  * `/proc/cpuinfo`: CPU details
  * `/proc/meminfo`: Memory usage
  * `/proc/[pid]`: Process info

---

### 📁 `/root` — **Root User’s Home Directory**

* This is **root user's** own home directory.
* Different from `/` and `/home/root`.

---

### 📁 `/run` — **Runtime Files**

* Temporary storage for **PID files, sockets**, etc.
* Recreated every boot.

---

### 📁 `/sbin` — **System Binaries**

* Contains **system binaries** used by root/admin for managing system.
* Examples: `fsck`, `ifconfig`, `reboot`, `mount`.

---

### 📁 `/srv` — **Service Data**

* Holds **data for services** like web servers or FTP.
* Examples: `/srv/ftp`, `/srv/www`.

---

### 📁 `/sys` — **System Information**

* Like `/proc`, it's a **virtual filesystem** exposing kernel devices and info.
* Used to interact with **hardware and kernel modules**.

---

### 📁 `/tmp` — **Temporary Files**

* Stores **temporary files** created by users/apps.
* Automatically cleaned up at boot.

---

### 📁 `/usr` — **User System Resources**

* Contains **secondary binaries, libraries, docs**.
* Subdirs include:

  * `/usr/bin`: User commands (non-essential)
  * `/usr/sbin`: Admin commands (non-essential)
  * `/usr/lib`: Libraries for apps in `/usr/bin`
  * `/usr/share`: Icons, fonts, docs

---

### 📁 `/var` — **Variable Files**

* Contains **log files, spool files**, mail, and temp data that changes constantly.
* Examples:

  * `/var/log`: Logs like `dmesg`, `messages`
  * `/var/mail`: User mailbox
  * `/var/spool`: Print jobs and cron tasks

---

### 📁 `/lost+found` — **Recovered Files**

* Used by `fsck` to **store recovered corrupt files**.
* Found on ext\* filesystems like ext3, ext4.
