load average: 0.52, 0.58, 0.59
load average for the system in last 1, 5 and 15 minutes

w

Tasks: 6 total, 1 running, 5 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie


%Cpu(s): 13.9 us, 9.5 sy, 0.0 ni, 76.3 id, 0.0 wa, 0.4 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st

us - user - All user processes are combined in this number. So, our sessions too.
sy - system - processes owned by system (kernel)
ni - nice - this is important to understand. nice allows us to change the priority of the process. The standard value for processes is 0 , but we can modify it from 19 (lowest) to -20 (highest) priority. This statistic here shows all processes with the niceness set abow 0. So, the processes which will be executed by the system, when "systemm will have time for it".
id - idle - idle time means that the system is bored and do nothing.
wa - iowait - the number repspresents the time (which is a subset of idle time) when the process is waiting for input/output operation. This statistic is very important, because it may show the issue outside the CPU, in other hardware (but not only) components.
hi - hardware interrupts. These are physical interrrupts from hardware and are handled by CPU itself.
si - software interrupts. These are generated by software and are handled by kernel.
st - steal time - very important to understand, especially when we are working on virtualized environment. This number represents the time "stealed" from the virtual machine by hypervisor. Another words, how long our system needs to wait for resources


PID - Process ID number. It is unique number of the process in the system.
USER - process' owner. The process is started by this user.
PR - default priority of the process, scheduled by kernel when process was started.
NI - nice. Shows the value, if nice was performed against the process.
VIRT - total amount of memory used by the process.
RES - RAM memory used by process.
SHR - amount of memory shared with other processes.
S - process state (we discussed it above).
%CPU - what amount of available CPU is used by the process.
%MEM - like for CPU, but this value represents memory usage.
TIME+ - total time of CPU usage by the process.
COMMAND - quite obvious, this process is executed.

ps 

ps -a 

ps a 

D - uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
I - Idle kernel thread
R - running or runnable (on run queue)
S - interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T - stopped by job control signal
t - stopped by debugger during the tracing
X - dead (should never be seen)
Z - defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

2nd letter
< - high-priority (not nice to other users)
N - low-priority (nice to other users)
s - is a session leader
l - is multi-threaded
+ - is in the foreground process group
